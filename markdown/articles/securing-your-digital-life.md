Your digital self controls your life. Lose your password, and you're locked out of
a potentially important email or bank account. It's even worse if you don't have
any recovery systems set up. But what's worse is if you are hacked. Your digital
self, ripped away. Your social media accounts, your connection to friends, family,
and others, disappearing in an instant. However, there are proactive measures you
can take.

## Passwords

The first thing you can do is ensure you have strong passwords. Try entering your
most commonly used passwords into [Security.org's tool](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/),
and see how long it takes to crack your password. According to a 2021 Statista survey,
64% of U.S. respondents had passwords 8–11 characters.[^1] Assuming a mix of numbers,
uppercase and lowercase letters, an 11-character password will take ten months to
crack.[^2]

The easiest way to secure your password is to get a password manager. I recommend
against using Google's password manager, given that it's built into your browser,
so if your browser is compromised, there goes your passwords. If you use an iOS/iPadOS
or Safari on macOS, Apple has a password manager built-in that's secured by end-to-end
encryption, as well as encrypted locally by the onboard chips until the password
is needed. Alternatively, if you use multiple platforms, or prefer not to use Apple's
offering, there's [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/),
and [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) to name a few. Definitely don't use LastPass,
their security has been well covered [in](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23618353/lastpass-security-breach-disclosure-password-vault-encryption-update)

If you choose to use a third-party password manager, make sure to set a strong password
for that. Bitwarden created a [password and passphrase generator](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/)
that you can use to create a master password.

No matter what password manager you use, the first step is to add all your existing
passwords to it. Whenever you create a new account, generate a strong password using
the tool. I recommend at least 20 characters using a mix of numbers, uppercase and
lowercase letters, and symbols (4+). Go through and change all your passwords to
strengthen them.
