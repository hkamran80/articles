## Free Practice 1

The stewards for FP1 were Nish Shetty, Vitantonio Liuzzi, Matthew Selley, and Dennis Dean.

- Valtteri Bottas (#77) was given a five grid place penalty for using his fourth Energy Store (ES),
  which will take effect during the race since there is no Sprint this weekend.

  **Explanation:** [Article 28.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2025_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_2_-_2024-10-17.pdf#page=30)
  says that "each driver may use no more than ... two (2) energy stores (ES)", with Article 28.3
  saying that if a driver exceeds those limits, the first time will result in a ten grid place penalty,
  and additional times will result in a five grid place penalty. Since this is Bottas' second additional
  energy store, the stewards gave him a five grid place penalty.
