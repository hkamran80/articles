Since May 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation has set the standard for data
privacy on a global scale. It grants European Economic Area (EEA) residents many privacy rights,
including the right to know what data organizations collect. Thanks to the [Brussels effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect),
many organizations comply with the GDPR even for non-EEA residents, and many jurisdictions have
adopted similar regulations.

## Origins

Under Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning
of the European Union (TFEU), the EU guarantees data protection as a fundamental right. In 1995, they
enacted Directive 95/46/EC, titled "on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing
of personal data and on the free movement of such data", known as the Data Protection Directive,
which provided the foundation for the European data protection legislation. However, as a directive
which is a "legislative act that sets out a goal that EU countries must achieve" which member states
devise their own laws to achieve, there were inconsistencies between member state implementations
which "create complexity, legal uncertainty and administrative costs", as well as "affect[ing] the
trust and confidence of individuals". The Directive was designed to provide safeguards on data
processing, not to prevent or limit the processing or use of information, or in the words of Peter
Hustinx, the European Data Protection Supervisor from 2004 to 2014, "data protection was about the
rights and interests of individuals ... not mainly about the data relating to those individuals".

To modernize the rules to bring them up to date with the digital age, the European Commission proposed
a regulation — a binding legislative act that applies throughout the EU — that would set a single set
of data protection rules in place across the bloc. The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC),
a consultative body of the EU, agreed with the proposal's objective, especially that the "the establishment
of a single set of data protection rules" would strengthen the data protection already offered by
the EU.

It took four years of work for the Council of the European Union, one of the EU's legislative bodies,
to adopt the proposed regulation, which they did 27-1. Austria was the lone holdout, saying that the
GDPR "in some respects falls short of that provided by the ... Data Protection Directive ... and its
implementation in national data protection law" and that it was "not possible to 'offset' these
deficits" because the intended form was an EU regulation. Later that month, the European Parliament,
one of the other legislative bodies, adopted the regulation. The Publications Office published it in
the *Official Journal of the European Union* a few weeks later. Under Article 99 of the regulation,
it entered force 20 days after publication and began applying on May 25, 2018.

## Definitions

There are a few definitions that are important to understand: data subject, controller, processor,
and personal data.

- A data subject is an individual who has personal data, or as defined in the regulation, "an identified
  or identifiable natural person".

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 4(1) -->

- A controller is the person or organisation who decides the purposes for which, and by which, personal
  data is processed. GDPR defines it as:

  > the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with
  > others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes
  > and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the
  > specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law

<!-- Cite: EDPB graphic, GDPR, art. 4(7) -->

- A processor is the person or organisation who processes personal data on behalf of a controller.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 4(8) -->

- Personal data is any identifier, such as "a name, an identification number, location data, an online
  identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental,
  economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person". An EDPB infographic defines it as
  "information relating to a living individual who is, or can be, identified, including data that
  can be combined with other information to identify an individual".

## Rights

The General Data Protection Regulation both strengthened previous rights under the previous Data
Protection Directive and gave EEA residents new ones.

### Right of access

Both the Directive and the GDPR guaranteed the right for data subject to know whether a controller
is processing their information, the purposes of the processing, the categories of the data, the
"recipients or categories of recipients" to whom their data was disclosed, and knowledge of the logic
involved in any automated decision-making.

<!-- Cite: DPD, art. 12(a); GDPR, art. 15(1)(a-c, h) -->

In addition, GDPR enshrined the right for data subjects to have access to their personal data, the
estimated duration that their information would be stored or the criteria used to determine it, any
"available information" about the source of data if the controller does not collect it themselves,
and the existence of "automated decision-making, including profiling", the significance, and the
estimated consequences of processing.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 15(1)(d, g, h) -->

In the event that a controller did not provide the information, GDPR also grants data subjects the
right to lodge a complaint with a [data protection authority](#).

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 15(1)(f) -->

### Right to correct

The right to rectification was first enshrined in GDPR and it guarantees data subjects can correct
inaccurate personal data concerning themselves without undue delay. They also have the right to
complete their personal data.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 16 -->

### Right to be forgotten

Also known as the right to erasure, GDPR guarantees data subjects the erasure of their personal data
without undue delay as long as one of six conditions applies:

- The personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes of processing
- The subject withdraws consent pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) (lawful processing with consent for one
  or more specific purposes), Article 9(2)(a) (explicit consent for one or more specific purposes),
  or where there is no legal ground
- The subject objects pursuant to [Article 21(1)](#) (right to object based on points (e) or (f) of Article
  6(1)) and there are no "overriding legitimate grounds for the processing", or the subject objects
  pursuant to [Article 21(2)](#) (right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes)
- The personal data was unlawfully processed
- The personal data must be erased for compliance with EU or Member State law
- The personal data was collected on a child, either with parental permission if they are younger
  than 16, or by the child themselves if they are older.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 17(1) -->

If the personal data was made public, the controller must take reasonable steps to inform other
controllers that the data subject has requested their erasure of "any links to, or copy or replication
of" their personal data.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 17(2) -->

However, if the processing is necessary — for exercising the right of freedom of expression and
information, complying with EU or Member State law, carried out in the public interest, in the exercise
of official authority, archival purposes "in the public interest, scientific or historical research
purposes or statistical purposes", or for "the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims"
— controllers do not have erase the personal data.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 17(3) -->

### Right to restrict processing

Data subjects have the right to restrict processing of their processing data so that their data may
only be processed with their consent, for legal claims, for the protection of rights of a person, or
for "important public interest" reasons in EU or Member State law. Storage is always allowed however.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 18(2) -->

One of four conditions must be met for a subject to restrict processing:

- The accuracy of personal data is contested
- Processing is unlawful, and instead of the subject requesting the erasure of their data, they
  request restricting the processing instead
- The controller no longer needs the data, but the data subject requires them to keep it for legal
  claims
- The subject has objected to the processing under [Article 21(1)](#) and it has yet to be determined
  whether the controller's legitimate grounds override those of the subject

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 18(1) -->

If a data subject has obtained a restriction, the controller must inform the data subject before the
restriction is lifted.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 18(3) -->

### Right to data portability

Data subjects have the right to get the personal data which they have provided from a controller in
a "structured, commonly used and machine-readable format". They also have the right to transmit that
to another controller without any hindrance if the processing is consented to based on Article 6(1)(a),
Article 9(2)(a), on contract pursuant to Article 6(1)(b), or if the processing is automated.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 20(1) -->

Subjects also have the right to transmit their personal data directly from one controller to another
where technically feasible.

<!-- Cite: GDPR, art. 20(2) -->
