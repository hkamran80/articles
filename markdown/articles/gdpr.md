Since May 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation has set the standard for data
privacy on a global scale. It grants European Economic Area (EEA) residents many privacy rights,
including the right to know what data organizations collect. Thanks to the [Brussels effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect),
many organizations comply with the GDPR even for non-EEA residents, and many jurisdictions have
adopted similar regulations.

## Origins

The GDPR was first proposed in 2012 through [Procedure 2012/0011/COD](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52012AE1303)
to ensure that "individuals have the right to enjoy effective control over their personal information",
a view shared by the European Commission and the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC).[^1]
The EU guarantees data protection as a fundamental right, protected by Article 8 of the Charter of
Fundamental Rights and Article 16(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).[^2]
Prior to the enactment of the GDPR, Directive 95/46 (EC) was the primary data protection law in the
EU. An EU directive is a "legislative act that sets out a goal that EU countries must achieve", but
is up to each country to implement.[^3] The EESC agreed that the "the establishment of a single set
of data protection rules" would strengthen the data protection already offered by the EU.[^4]

After four years of working on the regulation, the Council of the European Union adopted it 27-1.[^5]
Austria was the lone holdout, saying that GDPR "in some respects falls short of that provided by the
[1995 Directive]" and that it was "not possible to 'offset' these deficits" because the intended form
was an EU regulation.[^6] Later that month, the European Parliament adopted the regulation, followed
by its publication in the *Official Journal of the European Union* a few weeks later.[^7] Per Article
99, it entered force 20 days after its publication and began applying on May 25, 2018.[^8]

## Definitions

A data subject is someone who has their data processed.

Both the Directive and the GDPR defined a "controller" as a "natural or legal person, public authority,
agency or other body" that determines the "purposes and means of the processing of personal data"
when that is determined by EU or national laws, by the controller, or whether the "specific criteria
for its nomination" was provided by EU or national laws.[^9] In other words, a controller is an entity
that uses personal data.

## Rights

The General Data Protection Regulation both strengthened previous rights under the 1995 Directive
and gave EEA residents new ones.

### Right of Access

Article 12 of the Directive guaranteed data subjects' access to knowing if a controller is processing
their data, the purposes of the processing, the categories of the data, and the "recipients or
categories of recipients" to whom their data was disclosed.[^10]

Article 15 of the GDPR included the Directive's guarantees, but also enshrined the right for data
subjects to have access to their personal data, the estimated duration that their information would
be stored or the criteria used to determine it, any "available information" about the source of data
if the controller does not collect it themselves, and the existence of "automated decision-making,
including profiling", the logic involved, the significance, and the estimated consequences of
processing.[^11] The automated decision-making knowledge was covered in Article 15 of the Directive.[^12]
GDPR also gives subjects the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, known as a data
protection authority (DPA).[^13] Each EU member state has their own DPA.

### Right to Object

Articles 14 and 15 of the Directive cover the right to object. Specifically, data subjects have the
right to
