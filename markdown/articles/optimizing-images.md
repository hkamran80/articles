As a maintainer of the [2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory) and the [Passkeys Directory](https://passkeys.2fa.directory),
I submit and review many pull requests to keep our content up-to-date. To do so, I have to ensure
that our SVGs and PNGs are as small as possible to ensure a quick loading time when a user visits
our sites. For both file types, my process starts by finding the logo. If I am reviewing a PR, I will
download the logo attached if it is suitable enough. If it is not or if I am submitting a PR, I find
the highest quality logo I can. I first try to find an SVG from the website or service, or failing
that, a source like Wikipedia/Wikimedia or some other brand logo repository.
