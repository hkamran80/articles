1. Open a Google Docs file

   It can be any file, but I recommend a blank file.

2. Put some text in, such as [lorem ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/), and style it

   For example, select the text and change the font to Nunito Sans.

   Side note: I hate Arial. It's very ugly. I also dislike serif fonts.

3. Select your newly-formatted text, and apply it

   1. Click where it says "Normal text" next to the font name in the toolbar
   2. Hover over where the arrow is next to "Normal text" in the dropdown that opens
   3. Click "Update 'Normal text' to match"
   4. Repeat for each text element you want styled differently
        - For example, I styled my normal text, title, and headings with Nunito Sans

4. After making all the styling changes you want, open the dropdown, and hover over
   "Options", then click "Save as my default styles"

Now, if you are ever in a document that does not yet have your default styles,
simply open the dropdown in that document, hover over "Options", and click "Use
my default styles".
