Welcome to the final race of the 2024 Championship! It's Round 24 at Yas Marina Circuit in Yas Island,
near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. We've got an exciting weekend ahead of us! McLaren and
Ferrari both have the chance to win the constructors' championship, but McLaren looks better placed
to take it.

This weekend's Race Director is Rui Marques and the Technical Delegate, as always, is Jo Bauer. The
stewards for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix are Felix Holter, Derek Warwick, Loïc Bacquelaine, and Mohammed
Al Hashmi.

A list of drivers participating in the Grand Prix can be found in [Document 11 - Entry List](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Entry%20List.pdf#page=2).

## Silly Season Summary

There are a few changes ahead of the weekend. Esteban Ocon (#31) will not be racing this weekend
after Alpine team principal Oliver Oakes reportedly gave him an ultimatum: race this weekend or
participate in the post-season test with Haas. Opting for the latter, Jack Doohan (#61) will be taking
his seat early.

It's also a few drivers' final race in Formula 1 for the time being with Kevin Magnussen (#20),
Valtteri Bottas (#77), Zhou Guanyu (#24), Liam Lawson (#30), and Franco Colapinto (#43) not having seats next season.
This is the last race with their teams for a few drivers, most notably Lewis Hamilton (#44) who is
leaving his team of eleven years, Mercedes, to join the Maranello squad at Ferrari alongside Charles
Leclerc (#16). He replaces Carlos Sainz (#55) who is headed to Williams to take Logan Sargeant (#2)
and now Colapinto's seat. Ocon is headed to Haas, where will he drive alongside
Oliver Bearman (#87). Nico Hulkenberg (#27) is leaving Haas for Kick Sauber, before they transition
to the Audi F1 team in 2026. He will be partnered with Gabriel Bortoleto, both of whom are
replacing Bottas and Zhou. Pierre Gasly (#10) will be partnered with Doohan at Alpine, while George
Russell (#63) will be partnered with Kimi Antonelli.

The 2025 season will see four rookies join F1: Antonelli, Bearman, Doohan, and Bortoleto.

A few seats remain in the air, such as Doohan's, who might be replaced by Colapinto. A seat at one
of Red Bull's teams might also be up for grabs considering Sergio Perez (#11)'s recent poor performances
and the lack of a confirmed seat for Liam Lawson (#30).

## Free Practice 1

Free Practice 1 was scheduled to begin at 13:30 GST (09:30 UTC, 01:30 PST) on Friday, December 6.

- Six rookies participated in FP1 as required per [Article 32.4(c)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=40),
  which reads:
  > On one (1) occasion during the Championship, for each car entered for the Championship, each
  > Competitor must use a driver who has not participated in more than two (2) Championship races in
  > their career. Each Competitor must advise the FIA in writing seven (7) days prior to the start
  > of the relevant Competition with the details of the driver that they will use.

  In other words, each team must reserve two free practice sessions for rookies, one for each driver.
  Six teams fulfilled their obligations today with Max Verstappen (#1) sitting out for Isack Hadjar,
  Lance Stroll (#18) sitting out for Felipe Drugovich, Yuki Tsunoda (#22) sitting out for Ayumi Iwasa,
  Alex Albon (#23) sitting out for Luke Browning, Carlos Sainz (#55) sitting for Arthur Leclerc, and
  Oscar Piastri (#81) sitting out for Ryo Hirakawa.

  Arthur Leclerc's participation marks the first time in F1 history that brothers have participated
  in an F1 session as team mates. Leclerc was selected because Bearman, Ferrari's driver academy star,
  has participated in three Grands Prix, after subbing in for Kevin Magnussen in Brazil.

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) and Lando Norris (#4) were summoned to the Stewards because Hamilton allegedly
  impeded Norris in turn 16. The Stewards decided no further action because they concluded that it
  was "kind of a misunderstanding between the drivers involved, but does not meet the threshold of
  being considered as an unnecessary impeding in Free Practice."

- Charles Leclerc (#16) has been given a 10 grid place penalty for using his third Energy Store,
  which will take effect during the race since there is no Sprint this weekend.

  **Explanation:** [Article 28.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=29)
  says that "each driver may use no more than ... two (2) energy stores", while Article 28.3 says
  that the first time a driver exceeds those limits a ten grid place penalty will be imposed, with
  additional infringements resulting in five grid place penalties. Since this is Leclerc' first
  additional energy store, the stewards gave him a 10 grid place penalty.

- The Technical Delegate noted that Fernando Alonso (#14) used his second control electronics.

  **Explanation:** [Article 28.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=30)
  says that "each driver may use no more than ... two (2) control electronics". Alonso had previously
  only used one control electronics.

- Alex Albon (#23) and Franco Colapinto (#43) have been given a five grid place penalty for exceeding
  their allotment of gearbox case and cassette (GBX C & C), and gearbox driveline, gear change
  components, and auxiliary components (GBX DL).

  **Explanation:** [Article 29.2](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20New%20RNCs%20for%20this%20Competition.pdf)
  allows drivers to use up to five new gearbox components (GBX C & C and GBX DL) in a 24-round
  championship. Albon had previously used five and Colapinto six. Article 29.2(d) imposes a five grid
  place penalty per component, but Article 29.2(c) limits it to "the maximum of the penalty stated
  between the two types of RNC ... not the sum".

- Red Bull has been fined €900 because rookie Isack Hadjar (#37) exceeded the speed limit in the pit
  lane by driving at 88.2 km/h.

  **Explanation:** [Article 34.7](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=41)
  sets a speed limit of 80 km/h in the pit lane throughout the season, unless the Race Director amends
  it following a recommendation from the Safety Delegate. Article 34.7(a) says that "Any Competitor
  whose driver exceeds the limit during any free practice session, qualifying session, or sprint
  qualifying session will be fined €100 for each km/h above the limit, up to a maximum of €1000."
  The stewards, rounding up from 8.2 km/h, fined Oracle Red Bull Racing €900 accordingly.

  **Documents:** [Document 21 - Infringement - Car 37 - Pit Lane Speeding]

The top three drivers in FP1 were Charles Leclerc (#16) with a 1:24.321, followed by Lando Norris
(#4) with a 0.221 second gap (1:24.542), and Lewis Hamilton (#44) with a 0.485 second gap (1:24.806).

The six rookies finished ninth (Felipe Drugovich - 1.150 second gap, 1:25.471), fourteenth (Ryo
Hirakawa - 1.553 second gap, 1:25.874), fifteenth (Isack Hadjar - 1.556 second gap, 1:25.877),

for the full timing sheet.

## Free Practice 2

Free Practice 2 was scheduled to begin at 17:00 GST (13:00 UTC, 05:00 PST) on Friday, December 6.

- The Technical Delegate noted that Lewis Hamilton (#44) and Pierre Gasly (#10) ran a gearbox assembly
  outside the restricted number components (RNC) allocation.

  **Explanation:** A driver is allowed to exceed the gearbox assembly RNC allocation up to four times
  in FP1 or FP2 throughout the season by [Article 29.3(g)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=32).
  This was both drivers' third time running an assembly outside the RNC allocation in FP1 or FP2.

  **Documents:** [Document 28 - RNC used outside allocation](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20RNCs%20used%20outside%20allocation.pdf)

The top three drivers in FP2 were Lando Norris (#4) with a 1:23.517, followed by Oscar Piastri (#81)
with a 0.234 second gap (1:23.751), and Nico Hulkenberg (#27) with a 0.462 second gap (1:23.979).

for the full timing sheet.

## Free Practice 3

Free Practice 3 was scheduled to begin at 14:30 GST (10:30 UTC, 02:30 PST) on Saturday, December 7.

- The Technical Delegate noted that Charles Leclerc (#16) used his seventh exhaust system.

  **Explanation:** [Article 28.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=30)
  says that "each driver may use no more than ... eight (8) of each of the four (4) elements
  constituting a set of Engine exhaust systems". Leclerc had previously used six exhaust systems.

  **Documents:** [Document 30 - New PU elements for this Competition](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20New%20PU%20elements%20for%20this%20Competition_0.pdf#page=2)

The top three drivers in FP3 were Oscar Piastri (#81) with a 1:23.433, followed by Lando Norris (#4)
with a 0.193 second gap (1:23.626), and Lewis Hamilton (#44) with a 0.390 second gap (1:23.823).

for the full timing sheet.

## Qualifying

Qualifying was scheduled to begin at 18:00 GST (14:00 UTC, 06:00 PST) on Saturday, December 7.

### Session 1

- Franco Colapinto (#43) had his 1:24.411 lap deleted for track limits at turn 1.

- Sergio Perez (#11) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 1, then restored after review.

  I am of the opinion that his lap should not have been restored. From the [photo posted to F1's Twitter](https://x.com/F1/status/1865399092811063645),
  he looks completely off the track.

- Nico Hulkenberg (#27) received a three grid place penalty for overtaking two cars in the pit lane.

  **Explanation:** Item 12.4 of [Document 13 - Race Director's Event Notes V2](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Race%20Director%C2%B4s%20Event%20Notes%20V2.pdf#page=5)
  says that "Overtaking is prohibited in the pit exit road unless a car slows with an obvious problem."
  This is enforced by [I.S.C. Article 12.2.1(i)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/2024_international_sporting_code_fr-en_clean_version-_14.12.2023.pdf#page=51),
  which says that "Failure to follow the instructions of the relevant officials for the safe and
  orderly conduct of the Event" is considered a breach of the rules.

  Hulkenberg did not dispute the overtaking, but stated that he had no choice if he wanted to get a
  lap in. The Stewards acknowledged that "the position of the team’s garages limits their options to
  send the cars out on track", they also said it cannot be used as an excuse to breach the regulations.
  The grid drop is warranted in their eyes because overtaking in the pit lane is potentially dangerous.

- Lance Stroll (#18) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 1.

- Kevin Magnussen (#20) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 14.

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) fails to advance out of Q1 in his final qualifying with Mercedes because of
  a bollard accidentally thrown onto the racing line by Kevin Magnussen (#20) who was trying to get
  out of the way. See the video on [F1's Twitter page](https://twitter.com/F1/status/1865421960408080410).

Alex Albon (#23), Zhou Guanyu (#24), Lewis Hamilton (#44), Franco Colapinto (#43), and Jack Doohan
(#61) were eliminated in Q1.

The top three drivers were Charles Leclerc (#16) with a 1:23.302, followed by Valtteri Bottas (#77)
with a 0.179 second gap (1:23.481), and Carlos Sainz (#55) with a 0.185 second gap (1:23.487).

### Session 2

- Charles Leclerc had his pole-setting 1:22.980 lap deleted for track limits at turn 1.

Yuki Tsunoda (#22), Liam Lawson (#30), Lance Stroll (#18), Charles Leclerc (#16), and Kevin Magnussen
(#20) were eliminated in Q2.

The top three drivers were Carlos Sainz (#55) with a 1:22.985, followed by Max Verstappen (#1) with
a 0.013 second gap (1:22.998), and Nico Hulkenberg (#27) with a 0.055 second gap (1:22.040).

### Session 3

- Max Verstappen (#1) saved his car from snapping into the barriers on the last turn. See the video
  on [F1's Twitter page](https://x.com/F1/status/1865436105451200923).

The Q3 order is as follows: Lando Norris (#4), Oscar Piastri (#81), Carlos Sainz (#55), Nico Hulkenberg
(#27), Max Verstappen (#1), Pierre Gasly (#10), George Russell (#63), Fernando Alonso (#14), Valtteri
Bottas (#77), and Sergio Perez (#11).

and are authorized by [Article 12.4.1.e of the I.S.C.](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/2024_international_sporting_code_fr-en_clean_version-_14.12.2023.pdf#page=53)

## Race

The starting grid is: Lando Norris (#4), Oscar Piastri (#81), Carlos Sainz (#55), Max Verstappen (#1),
Pierre Gasly (#10), George Russell (#63), Nico Hulkenberg (#27), Fernando Alonso (#14), Valtteri
Bottas (#77), Sergio Perez (#11), Yuki Tsunoda (#22), Liam Lawson (#30), Lance Stroll (#18), Kevin
Magnussen (#20), Zhou Guanyu (#24), Lewis Hamilton (#44), Jack Doohan (#61), Alex Albon (#23), Charles
Leclerc (#16), and Franco Colapinto (#43). Albon and Colapinto received five grid place penalties
and Leclerc received a ten grid place penalty in [FP1](#free-practice-1), while Hulkenberg
received a three grid place penalty in [Q1](#session-1).

This is Norris' eighth pole of the season, tying him up with Max Verstappen. See
[Document 44 - Final Starting Grid](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Final%20Starting%20Grid.pdf#page=2)
for the grid and qualifying times.

The race was scheduled to begin at 17:00 GST (13:00 UTC, 05:00 PST) on Sunday, December 8.

- Kevin Magnussen (#20) was investigated for a practice start at the pit exit before the race, but
  no further action was taken.

  **Explanation:** [I.S.C. Article 12.2.1.i](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/2024_international_sporting_code_fr-en_clean_version-_14.12.2023.pdf#page=51)
  requires that drivers follow the "instructions of the relevant officials for the safe and orderly
  conduct" at an event. Item 10.1 of [Document 13 - Race Director's Event Notes V2](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Race%20Director%C2%B4s%20Event%20Notes%20V2.pdf#page=4)
  prohibits practice starts at the pit exit. The Stewards found that Magnussen did rev his engine
  "for a fraction of a second before pulling away", but that is not considered a practice start.

  **Documents:** [Document 55 - Decision - Car 20 - Alleged failure to follow Race Director's instructions (Practice start)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Decision%20-%20Car%2020%20-%20Alleged%20failure%20to%20follow%20Race%20Director's%20instructions%20(Practice%20start).pdf)

- Max Verstappen (#1) was given a ten-second penalty and two penalty points for causing a collision
  with Oscar Piastri (#81) on the first turn.

  **Explanation:** [I.S.C. Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2(d)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/4_-_appendix_l_2024_publie_le_17_october_2024.pdf#page=57)
  says that "causing a collision ... will be reported to the Stewards and may entail the imposition
  of penalties up to and including the disqualification of any driver concerned." Verstappen attempted
  to overtake Piastri on the inside into turn one, but did not get ahead to pull up alongisde. His
  front right tyre hit Piastri's rear left, causing both to spin. Verstappen spun 360 degrees on the
  left side of the track, off the racing line, while Piastri spun 180 degrees in the runoff area.
  The Stewards found Verstappen "wholly at fault".

  Verstappen is up to eight penalty points in the twelve-month period.

  **Documents:** [Document 45 - Infringement - Car 1 - Causing a collision](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%201%20-%20Causing%20a%20collision.pdf)

- Valtteri Bottas (#77) was given a ten-second penalty and two penalty points for causing a collision
  with Sergio Perez (#11) on the sixth turn.

  **Explanation:** [I.S.C. Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2(d)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/4_-_appendix_l_2024_publie_le_17_october_2024.pdf#page=57)
  says that "causing a collision ... will be reported to the Stewards and may entail the imposition
  of penalties up to and including the disqualification of any driver concerned." Bottas attempted
  to overtake Perez on the outside of turn six but ran over the inside kerb and hit Perez's rear left
  tyre. Bottas was found "wholly at fault".

  These are Bottas' only penalty points in the twelve-month period.

  **Documents:** [Document 46 - Infringement - Car 77 - Causing a collision](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2077%20-%20Causing%20a%20collision.pdf)

- Charles Leclerc (#16) has moved up to eighth from sixteenth in the first few turns of lap one.

- Sergio Perez (#11) is the first to retire from the Grand Prix on lap one after his collision and
  spin with Bottas.

- Oscar Piastri (#81) was given a ten-second penalty and two penalty points for causing a collision
  with Franco Colapinto (#43) on the approach to turn six turn on lap four.

  **Explanation:** [I.S.C. Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2(d)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/4_-_appendix_l_2024_publie_le_17_october_2024.pdf#page=57)
  says that "causing a collision ... will be reported to the Stewards and may entail the imposition
  of penalties up to and including the disqualification of any driver concerned." Piastri braked late
  on the approach to turn six after misjudging the distance to the cars in front of him and collided
  with the back of Colapinto.

  Piastri is up to four penalty points in the twelve-month period.

  **Documents:** [Document 47 - Infringement - Car 81 - Causing a collision](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2081%20-%20Causing%20a%20collision.pdf)

- Zhou Guanyu (#24) was given a five-second penalty for a false start.

  **Explanation:** [Article 48.1(a)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=58)
  says that drivers cannot "move after the four (4) second light is illuminated and before the start
  signal is given by extinguishing all red lights". Zhou moved just after the four-second light was
  illuminated, but it being a very slight movement and no significant sporting advantage, the Stewards
  imposed the least severe penalty.

- Liam Lawson (#30) was given a ten-second stop-and-go penalty for being released from a pit stop in
  an unsafe condition.

  **Explanation:** [Article 34.14(d)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=42)
  says that if a car is released in an unsafe condition, a penalty in accordance with
  [Article 54.3(d)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=61)
  ("ten second stop-and-go time penalty") will be imposed on the driver. Lawson was released with
  his front left wheel not fastened correctly, completed one lap, then came back into the pits to
  have it fastened correctly.

- Valtteri Bottas (#77) received a five grid place penalty in his next race and three penalty points
  for colliding with the side of Kevin Magnussen (#20) in turn six.

  **Explanation:** [I.S.C. Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2(d)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/4_-_appendix_l_2024_publie_le_17_october_2024.pdf#page=57)
  says that "causing a collision ... will be reported to the Stewards and may entail the imposition
  of penalties up to and including the disqualification of any driver concerned." Bottas was on the
  inside on the approach to the turn, misjudged his braking "significantly", and collided with the
  side of Magnussen who was entering on the normal racing line.

  Bottas has a total of five penalty points for the twelve-month period. The Stewards opted to give
  him a grid penalty instead of a drivethrough penalty because it is the equivalent given he retired
  from the race shortly after.

  **Documents:** [Document 50 - Infringement - Car 77 - Causing a collision (2nd)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2077%20-%20Causing%20a%20collision%20(2nd).pdf)

- Valtteri Bottas (#77) has retired from the Grand Prix.

- Lance Stroll (#18) was given a five-second penalty for leaving the track multiple times without a
  justifiable reason.

  **Explanation:** [Article 33.3](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=40)
  mandates that drivers make "every reasonable effort" to use the track at all times and may not leave
  without a "justifiable reason." Stroll did not have a justifiable reason on four separate occasions,
  even after he had been shown the black and white flag on the third occurrence. The Stewards added
  his penalty to his elapsed race time because of the lack of time for a pit stop. He remains P18.

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) pits for mediums and is told by his race engineer, Peter Bonnington, for the
  last time:

  > Ok, Lewis. Strat mode five and it's hammer time.

- George Russell (#63) has been told to keep it "super clean", meaning he can fight with Hamilton
  for fourth. Hamilton closed a fourteen-second gap.

- Lando Norris (#4) wins the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and secures McLaren's first constructors' championship
  win since 1998!

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) has overtaken George Russell (#63) a few turns before the chequered flag and
  advances to fourth!

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) and Zhou Guanyu (#24) do donuts on the grid.

Lando Norris (#4) finished first after leading for the entire race, followed by Carlos Sainz (#55)
and Charles Leclerc (#16). Leclerc started from P19 and finished P3, making up sixteen positions.
Lewis Hamilton (#44) finished P4 after starting from P16, making up twelve positions, including a
pass on his now-former teammate, George Russell (#63), on the final lap. Russell finished fifth,
followed by Max Verstappen (#1).

Kevin Magnussen (#20) set the fastest lap on lap 57 with a 1:25.637, but he did not receive the bonus
point.

This was the final race for Kevin Magnussen (#20), Franco Colapinto (#43), Liam Lawson (#30), Valtteri
Bottas (#77), and Zhou Guanyu (#24).

Four drivers did not finish the race: Sergio Perez (#11) on lap one, Franco Colapinto (#43) on lap
27, Valtteri Bottas (#77) on lap 31, and Liam Lawson (#30) on lap 56. Lawson was still classified
because he had completed more than 90% of the laps covered by the winner, Norris, per
[Article 61.2](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=70).

This is Norris' fourth win this season. See [Document 57 - Final Race Classification](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Final%20Race%20Classification.pdf#page=2)

Congratulations to all the drivers and teams! See you all next year for the 2025 Championship!
