Welcome to the final race of the 2024 Championship! It's Round 24 at Yas Marina Circuit in Yas Island,
near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. We've got an exciting weekend ahead of us! McLaren and
Ferrari both have the chance to win the constructors' championship, but McLaren looks better placed
to take it.

This weekend's Race Director is Rui Marques and the Technical Delegate, as always, is Jo Bauer. The
stewards for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix are Felix Holter, Derek Warwick, Loïc Bacquelaine, and Mohammed
Al Hashmi.

A list of drivers participating in the Grand Prix can be found in [Document 11 - Entry List](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Entry%20List.pdf#page=2).

## Silly Season Summary

There are a few changes ahead of the weekend. Esteban Ocon (#31) will not be racing this weekend
after Alpine team principal Oliver Oakes reportedly gave him an ultimatum: race this weekend or
participate in the post-season test with Haas. Opting for the latter, Jack Doohan (#61) will be taking
his seat early.

It's also a few drivers' final race in Formula 1 for the time being with Kevin Magnussen (#20),
Valtteri Bottas (#77), Zhou Guanyu (#24), Liam Lawson (#30), and Franco Colapinto (#43) not having seats next season.
This is the last race with their teams for a few drivers, most notably Lewis Hamilton (#44) who is
leaving his team of eleven years, Mercedes, to join the Maranello squad at Ferrari alongside Charles
Leclerc (#16). He replaces Carlos Sainz (#55) who is headed to Williams to take Logan Sargeant (#2)
and now Colapinto's seat. Ocon is headed to Haas, where will he drive alongside
Oliver Bearman (#87). Nico Hulkenberg (#27) is leaving Haas for Kick Sauber, before they transition
to the Audi F1 team in 2026. He will be partnered with Gabriel Bortoleto, both of whom are
replacing Bottas and Zhou. Pierre Gasly (#10) will be partnered with Doohan at Alpine, while George
Russell (#63) will be partnered with Kimi Antonelli.

The 2025 season will see four rookies join F1: Antonelli, Bearman, Doohan, and Bortoleto.

A few seats remain in the air, such as Doohan's, who might be replaced by Colapinto. A seat at one
of Red Bull's teams might also be up for grabs considering Sergio Perez (#11)'s recent poor performances
and the lack of a confirmed seat for Liam Lawson (#30).

## Free Practice 1

Free Practice 1 was scheduled to begin at 13:30 GST (09:30 UTC, 01:30 PST) on Friday, December 6.

- Six rookies participated in FP1 as required per [Article 32.4(c)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=40),
  which reads:
  > On one (1) occasion during the Championship, for each car entered for the Championship, each
  > Competitor must use a driver who has not participated in more than two (2) Championship races in
  > their career. Each Competitor must advise the FIA in writing seven (7) days prior to the start
  > of the relevant Competition with the details of the driver that they will use.

  In other words, each team must reserve two free practice sessions for rookies, one for each driver.
  Six teams fulfilled their obligations today with Max Verstappen (#1) sitting out for Isack Hadjar,
  Lance Stroll (#18) sitting out for Felipe Drugovich, Yuki Tsunoda (#22) sitting out for Ayumi Iwasa,
  Alex Albon (#23) sitting out for Luke Browning, Carlos Sainz (#55) sitting for Arthur Leclerc, and
  Oscar Piastri (#81) sitting out for Ryo Hirakawa.

  Arthur Leclerc's participation marks the first time in F1 history that brothers have participated
  in an F1 session as team mates. Leclerc was selected because Bearman, Ferrari's driver academy star,
  has participated in three Grands Prix, after subbing in for Kevin Magnussen in Brazil.

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) and Lando Norris (#4) were summoned to the Stewards because Hamilton allegedly
  impeded Norris in turn 16. The Stewards decided no further action because they concluded that it
  was "kind of a misunderstanding between the drivers involved, but does not meet the threshold of
  being considered as an unnecessary impeding in Free Practice."

- Charles Leclerc (#16) has been given a 10 grid place penalty for using his third Energy Store,
  which will take effect during the race since there is no Sprint this weekend.

  **Explanation:** [Article 28.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=29)
  says that "each driver may use no more than ... two (2) energy stores", while Article 28.3 says
  that the first time a driver exceeds those limits a ten grid place penalty will be imposed, with
  additional infringements resulting in five grid place penalties. Since this is Leclerc' first
  additional energy store, the stewards gave him a 10 grid place penalty.

- The Technical Delegate noted that Fernando Alonso (#14) used his second control electronics.

  **Explanation:** [Article 28.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=30)
  says that "each driver may use no more than ... two (2) control electronics". Alonso had previously
  only used one control electronics.

- Alex Albon (#23) and Franco Colapinto (#43) have been given a five grid place penalty for exceeding
  their allotment of gearbox case and cassette (GBX C & C), and gearbox driveline, gear change
  components, and auxiliary components (GBX DL).

  **Explanation:** [Article 29.2](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20New%20RNCs%20for%20this%20Competition.pdf)
  allows drivers to use up to five new gearbox components (GBX C & C and GBX DL) in a 24-round
  championship. Albon had previously used five and Colapinto six. Article 29.2(d) imposes a five grid
  place penalty per component, but Article 29.2(c) limits it to "the maximum of the penalty stated
  between the two types of RNC ... not the sum".

- Red Bull has been fined €900 because rookie Isack Hadjar (#37) exceeded the speed limit in the pit
  lane by driving at 88.2 km/h.

  **Explanation:** [Article 34.7](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=41)
  sets a speed limit of 80 km/h in the pit lane throughout the season, unless the Race Director amends
  it following a recommendation from the Safety Delegate. Article 34.7(a) says that "Any Competitor
  whose driver exceeds the limit during any free practice session, qualifying session, or sprint
  qualifying session will be fined €100 for each km/h above the limit, up to a maximum of €1000."
  The stewards, rounding up from 8.2 km/h, fined Oracle Red Bull Racing €900 accordingly.

  **Documents:** [Document 21 - Infringement - Car 37 - Pit Lane Speeding]

The top three drivers in FP1 were Charles Leclerc (#16) with a 1:24.321, followed by Lando Norris
(#4) with a 0.221 second gap (1:24.542), and Lewis Hamilton (#44) with a 0.485 second gap (1:24.806).

## Free Practice 2

Free Practice 2 was scheduled to begin at 17:00 GST (13:00 UTC, 05:00 PST) on Friday, December 6.

- The Technical Delegate noted that Lewis Hamilton (#44) and Pierre Gasly (#10) ran a gearbox assembly
  outside the restricted number components (RNC) allocation.

  **Explanation:** A driver is allowed to exceed the gearbox assembly RNC allocation up to four times
  in FP1 or FP2 throughout the season by [Article 29.3(g)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=32).
  This was both drivers' third time running an assembly outside the RNC allocation in FP1 or FP2.

  **Documents:** [Document 28 - RNC used outside allocation](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20RNCs%20used%20outside%20allocation.pdf)

for the full timing sheet.

## Free Practice 3

Free Practice 3 was scheduled to begin at 14:30 GST (10:30 UTC, 02:30 PST) on Saturday, December 7.

- The Technical Delegate noted that Charles Leclerc (#16) used his seventh exhaust system.

  **Explanation:** [Article 28.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=30)
  says that "each driver may use no more than ... eight (8) of each of the four (4) elements
  constituting a set of Engine exhaust systems". Leclerc had previously used six exhaust systems.

for the full timing sheet.

## Qualifying

Qualifying was scheduled to begin at 18:00 GST (14:00 UTC, 06:00 PST) on Saturday, December 7.

### Session 1

- Franco Colapinto (#43) had his 1:24.411 lap deleted for track limits at turn 1.

- Sergio Perez (#11) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 1, then restored after review.

  I am of the opinion that his lap should not have been restored. From the [photo posted to F1's Twitter](https://x.com/F1/status/1865399092811063645),
  he looks completely off the track.

- Nico Hulkenberg (#27) received a three grid place penalty for overtaking two cars in the pit lane.

  **Explanation:** Item 12.4 of [Document 13 - Race Director's Event Notes V2](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Race%20Director%C2%B4s%20Event%20Notes%20V2.pdf#page=5)
  says that "Overtaking is prohibited in the pit exit road unless a car slows with an obvious problem."
  This is enforced by [I.S.C. Article 12.2.1(i)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/2024_international_sporting_code_fr-en_clean_version-_14.12.2023.pdf#page=51),
  which says that "Failure to follow the instructions of the relevant officials for the safe and
  orderly conduct of the Event" is considered a breach of the rules.

  Hulkenberg did not dispute the overtaking, but stated that he had no choice if he wanted to get a
  lap in. The Stewards acknowledged that "the position of the team’s garages limits their options to
  send the cars out on track", they also said it cannot be used as an excuse to breach the regulations.
  The grid drop is warranted in their eyes because overtaking in the pit lane is potentially dangerous.

- Lance Stroll (#18) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 1.

- Kevin Magnussen (#20) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 14.

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) fails to advance out of Q1 in his final qualifying with Mercedes because of
  a bollard accidentally thrown onto the racing line by Kevin Magnussen (#20) who was trying to get
  out of the way. See the video on [F1's Twitter page](https://twitter.com/F1/status/1865421960408080410).

Alex Albon (#23), Zhou Guanyu (#24), Lewis Hamilton (#44), Franco Colapinto (#43), and Jack Doohan
(#61) were eliminated in Q1.

a 0.013 second gap (1:22.998), and Nico Hulkenberg (#27) with a 0.055 second gap (1:22.040).

### Session 3

- Max Verstappen (#1) saved his car from snapping into the barriers on the last turn. See the video
  on [F1's Twitter page](https://x.com/F1/status/1865436105451200923).
