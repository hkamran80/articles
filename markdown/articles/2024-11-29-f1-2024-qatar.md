- Franco Colapinto (#43) had his 1:23.535 lap deleted for track limits at turn 6.
- Alex Albon (#23) had his 1:22.873 lap deleted for track limits at turn 6.
- Lance Stroll (#18) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 2.
- Kevin Magnussen (#20) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 4.
- Lando Norris (#4) had his 1:21.437 lap deleted for track limits at turn 6.
- Fernando Alonso (#14) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 10.

Alex Albon (#23), Liam Lawson (#30), Nico Hulkenberg (#27), Franco Colapinto (#43), Esteban Ocon
(#31) were eliminated in Q1.

The top three drivers were George Russell (#63) with a 1:21.241, followed by Charles Leclerc (#16)
with a 0.037 second gap (1:21.278), and Carlos Sainz (#55) with a 0.206 second gap (1:21.447).

### Session 2

- Sergio Perez (#11) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 4.

- Fernando Alonso (#14) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 10.

- Carlos Sainz (#55) was fined €5,000 for a unsafe release from the garage into the pit lane and the
  path of Lewis Hamilton (#44).

  **Explanation:** [Article 34.14(a)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=42)
  says that "Cars must not be released from a garage or pit stop position in way that could endanger
  pit lane personnel or another driver". Sainz's release, seen in
  [this photo from the F1 Twitter account](https://twitter.com/F1/status/1862929472691015757),
  was deemed unsafe after the Stewards heard from Sainz, Hamilton, team representatives, and watched
  multiple videos. Sainz's number 1 mechanic signalled for him to be released before Sainz was ready,
  resulting in a small delay which caused Hamilton to take evasive action when he was released.

Pierre Gasly (#10), Zhou Guanyu (#24), Valtteri Bottas (#77), Yuki Tsunoda (#20), and Lance Stroll
(#18) were eliminated from Q2.

The top three drivers were Max Verstappen (#1) with a 1:20.687, followed by Lando Norris (#4) with
a 0.296 second gap (1:20.983), and Charles Leclerc with a 0.313 second gap (1:21.000).

### Session 3

- Fernando Alonso (#14) had his 1:21.320 lap deleted for track limits at turn 10.

- Max Verstappen (#1) received a one grid place penalty and a single penalty point for driving
  unnecessarily slowly on a cool down lap, getting in the way of George Russell (#63).

  **Explanation:** [Article 33.4](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2055%20-%20Alleged%20unsafe%20release.pdf#page=40)
  says that no car may be driven "unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be
  deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person" at any time. Russell said that
  "if a car was going slow in a high speed corner, it should not be on the racing line." Verstappen
  did not comply with the Race Director's Event Notes by driving unnecessarily slowly, but the penalty
  was less than the usual one (a three grid place penalty) because neither Verstappen nor Russell
  were on push laps at the time of the incident.

  This penalty point is his sixth in the twelve-month period.
