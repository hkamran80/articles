## Free Practice 1

- Valtteri Bottas (#77) was given a five grid place penalty for using his fourth Energy Store, which
  will take effect during the race since there is no Sprint this weekend.

  **Explanation:** [Article 28.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=29)
  says that "each driver may use no more than ... two (2) energy stores", while Article 28.3 says
  that the first time a driver exceeds those limits a ten grid place penalty will be imposed, with
  additional infringements resulting in five grid place penalties. Since this is Bottas' second
  additional energy store, the stewards gave him a five grid place penalty.

The top three drivers in FP1 were Lewis Hamilton (#44) with a 1:35.001, followed by George Russell
(#63) with a 0.396 second gap (1:35.397), and Lando Norris (#4) with a 0.953 second gap (1:35.954).

for the full timing sheet.

## Free Practice 2

- A red flag was issued when Alex Albon (#23)'s car stopped on track because of a fuel
  systems issue. He managed to stop near an opening in the barriers, allowing the session to be
  restarted quickly. Williams will have to wait until after the session to retrieve it.

- The Technical Delegate noted that Carlos Sainz (#55) ran a gearbox assembly outside the restricted
  number components (RNC) allocation.

  **Explanation:** A driver is allowed to exceed the gearbox assembly RNC allocation up to four times
  in FP1 or FP2 throughout the season by [Article 29.3(g)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=32).
  This was Sainz's fourth time, so he can no longer run gearbox assemblies outside the RNC allocation
  in FP1 or FP2.

  **Documents:** [Document 16 - RNC used outside allocation](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Las%20Vegas%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20RNC%20used%20outside%20allocation.pdf)

The top three drivers in FP2 were Lewis Hamilton (#44) with a 1:33.825, followed by George Russell
(#63) with a 0.011 second gap (1:33.836), and Lando Norris (#4) with a 0.190 second gap (1:34.015).
Max Verstappen (#1) finished 17th with a 1:35.834, 2.009 seconds off Hamilton and 1.819 seconds off
World Champion challenger Norris. See [Document 15 - P2 Classification](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Las%20Vegas%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20P2%20Classification.pdf#page=2)
for the full timing sheet.

## Free Practice 3

- Aston Martin was fined €200 because Fernando Alonso (#14) exceeded the speed limit in the pit lane
  by driving at 81.3 km/h.

  **Explanation:** [Article 34.7](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=41)
  sets a speed limit of 80 km/h in the pit lane throughout the season, unless the Race Director amends
  it following a recommendation from the Safety Delegate. Article 34.7(a) says that "Any Competitor
  whose driver exceeds the limit during any free practice session, qualifying session, or sprint
  qualifying session will be fined €100 for each km/h above the limit, up to a maximum of €1000."
  The stewards, rounding up from 1.3 km/h, fined Aston Martin Aramco F1 Team €200 accordingly.

  **Documents:** [Document 22 - Infringement - Car 14 - Pit lane speeding](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Las%20Vegas%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2014%20-%20Pit%20lane%20speeding.pdf)[^1]

- A red flag was issued when Lance Stroll (#18)'s AMR24 began smoking, which appeared to be coming
  from the front brakes. While he did manage to park it by a gap in the barriers, the batteries made
  the car unsafe to recover for the time being. The session restarted at 19:29 without enough time
  for a timed lap but enough for a practice start on the grid.

The top three drivers in FP3 were George Russell (#63) with a 1:33.570, followed by Oscar Piastri
(#81) with a 0.215 second gap (1:33.785), and Carlos Sainz (#55) with a 0.348 second gap (1:33.918).

Lando Norris (#4) went fourth-fastest with a 1:34.008, 0.438 seconds off Russell. Max Verstappen (#1)
improved to fifth-fastest with a 1:34.137, 0.129 seconds off Norris and 0.567 seconds off Russell.
Lewis Hamilton (#44), the leader in FP1 and FP2, went sixth-fastest with a 1:34.341, 0.771 seconds
off teammate Russell.
