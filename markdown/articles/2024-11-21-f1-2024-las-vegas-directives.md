## Free Practice 1

- Valtteri Bottas (#77) was given a five grid place penalty for using his fourth Energy Store, which
  will take effect during the race since there is no Sprint this weekend.

  **Explanation:** [Article 28.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=29)
  says that "each driver may use no more than ... two (2) energy stores", while Article 28.3 says
  that the first time a driver exceeds those limits a ten grid place penalty will be imposed, with
  additional infringements resulting in five grid place penalties. Since this is Bottas' second
  additional energy store, the stewards gave him a five grid place penalty.

## Free Practice 2

- A red flag was issued when Alex Albon (#23)'s car stopped on track because of a fuel
  systems issue. He managed to stop near an opening in the barriers, allowing the session to be
  restarted quickly. Williams will have to wait until after the session to retrieve it.

- The Technical Delegate noted that Carlos Sainz (#55) ran a gearbox assembly outside the restricted
  number components (RNC) allocation.

  **Explanation:** A driver is allowed to exceed the gearbox assembly RNC allocation up to four times
  in FP1 or FP2 throughout the season by [Article 29.3(g)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=32).
  This was Sainz's fourth time, so he can no longer run gearbox assemblies outside the RNC allocation
  in FP1 or FP2.

  **Documents:** [Document 16 - RNC used outside allocation](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Las%20Vegas%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20RNC%20used%20outside%20allocation.pdf)

The top three drivers in FP2 were Lewis Hamilton (#44) with a 1:33.825, followed by George Russell
(#63) with a 0.011 second gap (1:33.836), and Lando Norris (#4) with a 0.190 second gap (1:34.015).
Max Verstappen (#1) finished 17th with a 1:35.834, 2.009 seconds off Hamilton and 1.819 seconds off
World Champion challenger Norris. See [Document 15 - P2 Classification](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Las%20Vegas%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20P2%20Classification.pdf#page=2)
