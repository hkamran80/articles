"Artificial intelligence" is becoming embedded in everything nowadays: word processors, legislatures,
education, health, and everything else you can imagine. Google is [forcing it upon all Android users](https://www.laptopmag.com/ai/gemini-phone-access-update)
by removing the user-configurable restriction that blocked access to calls, messages, WhatsApp, and
utilities like volume, flashlight, alarm, and media controls. Now Gemini will have access to all of
those regardless of the activity tracking status.

> Gemini will soon be able to help you use Phone, Messages, WhatsApp, and Utilities on your phone,
> **whether your Gemini Apps Activity is on or off**.

Google claims they won't save the requests or use them to train their models if Apps Activity is
disabled, but they will keep the data for up to 72 hours for "service reliability and safety checks".
