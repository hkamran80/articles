I just recently upgraded to macOS Catalina, and needed to flash a microSD card
for my Raspberry Pi. However, balenaEtcher was throwing an error when trying to
flash the image.

After a little while, I realized that Catalina included some extra privacy protections.
I went into System Preferences and turned on “Full Disk Access” for balenaEtcher.
But lo and behold, the error still persisted.

## The Solution

After doing a bit of research, I found that balenaEtcher, and Etcher (the former
name of balenaEtcher), had a command-line utility to launch the app.

`sudo /Applications/balenaEtcher.app/Contents/MacOS/balenaEtcher`

The command booted up a graphical interface of balenaEtcher, the difference that,
because of the “sudo” in the command, it ran under the root user. This bypassed
the security/privacy restrictions placed (wisely) by Apple on Catalina.
