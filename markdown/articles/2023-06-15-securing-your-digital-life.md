Your digital self controls your life. Lose your password, and you're locked out of
a potentially important email or bank account. It's even worse if you don't have
any recovery systems set up. But what's worse is if you are hacked. Your digital
self, ripped away. Your social media accounts, your connection to friends, family,
and others, disappearing in an instant. However, there are proactive measures you
can take.

## Passwords

The first thing you can do is ensure you have strong passwords. Try entering your
most commonly used passwords into [Security.org's tool](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/),
and see how long it takes to crack your password. According to a 2021 Statista survey,
64% of U.S. respondents had passwords 8â€“11 characters.[^1] Assuming a mix of numbers,
uppercase and lowercase letters, an 11-character password will take ten months to
crack.[^2]

The easiest way to secure your password is to get a password manager. I recommend
against using Google's password manager, given that it's built into your browser,
so if your browser is compromised, there goes your passwords. If you use an iOS/iPadOS
or Safari on macOS, Apple has a password manager built-in that's secured by end-to-end
encryption, as well as encrypted locally by the onboard chips until the password
is needed. Alternatively, if you use multiple platforms, or prefer not to use Apple's
offering, there's [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/),
and [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) to name a few. Definitely don't use LastPass,
their security has been well covered [in](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23618353/lastpass-security-breach-disclosure-password-vault-encryption-update)
[the](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2023/03/03/why-you-should-stop-using-lastpass-after-new-hack-method-update/)
[media](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/lastpass-hackers-infected-employees-home-computer-and-stole-corporate-vault/).

If you choose to use a third-party password manager, make sure to set a strong password
for that. Bitwarden created a [password and passphrase generator](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/)
that you can use to create a master password.

No matter what password manager you use, the first step is to add all your existing
passwords to it. Whenever you create a new account, generate a strong password using
the tool. I recommend at least 20 characters using a mix of numbers, uppercase and
lowercase letters, and four or more symbols. Go through all your passwords and strengthen
them by changing your passwords.

### Breach Alerts

The number one rule when it comes to passwords is **do not reuse them**. Many services,
including 500px, Adobe, Audi, Bitly, and [many others](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites),
have been breached, resulting in passwords, emails, and other sensitive information
being stolen. A wonderful, free service called [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
(HIBP), created by security researcher [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/about/)
and used by companies and [governments](https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/government/)
around the world, shows users which of their accounts have been breached[^3], and
can also inform them as soon as a breach is published. I highly recommend putting
your emails into the service to check if any associated accounts have been breached,
and if they have, change the passwords. The other thing I highly recommend is
[signing up for HIBP notifications](https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe) on all
your emails. This will allow you to know almost immediately if your account was
leaked in a breach.

## Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication, also known as two-factor authentication, 2FA, or MFA,
is where a user is required to enter two or more verification methods before authentication
can proceed. You should enable multi-factor authentication on all your accounts,
especially for those accounts that secure personal identifiable information (PII)[^4].
Some key accounts that should absolutely be secured, even if you don't use MFA on
any other service, include your financial accounts (including revenue agencies like
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the Canada Revenue Agency, AFIP, etc.), your
government accounts (e.g. Login.gov, Singpass, etc.), and your healthcare accounts
(e.g. insurance, patient portals (like MyChart), etc.).

Don't just take my word for it. Many government agencies, including, but certainly
not limited to, the [U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/MFA),
the [UK National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/setting-2-step-verification-2sv),
and the [Australian Cyber Security Centre](https://www.cyber.gov.au/learn-basics/explore-basics/mfa),
recommend MFA.

When you enable MFA, try to avoid text messages, phone calls, and email as authentication
methods. Text messages and phone calls are susceptible to a SIM swap scam, which
is when a malicious person contacts a mobile service provider to change the SIM
which has phone calls and text messages routed to it. For more information on SIM
swap scams, check out [the Wikipedia page](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam)
or [this Norton article](https://us.norton.com/blog/mobile/sim-swap-fraud).

The best method to use is [FIDO2](https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/), also known as
[WebAuthn](https://www.yubico.com/authentication-standards/webauthn/). FIDO2 uses
physical security keys, such as [Yubico's YubiKey series](https://www.yubico.com/products/)
or [Google's Titan keys](https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key), or
[mobile devices](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9289445). These
devices make up phishing-resistant MFA. This name was given because the token that
is generated for MFA will not work with any site other than the site it was registered
with. It's recommended to register at least two keys per account in case you lose
one. Some, like Apple, [require at least two keys](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213154).
The U.S. federal government requires phishing-resistant MFA through
[the Federal Zero Trust Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf#page=4).
The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is recommending phishing-resistant
MFA through the [draft version of SP 800-63-4 (Digital Identity Guidelines)](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-63-4.ipd)[^6].
Many companies, including [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-implemented-fido2-and-zero-trust)
and [Figma](https://twitter.com/frgx/status/1379504541666701313), have mandated
FIDO2 security keys because they are phishing-resistant.

In the event that the site doesn't offer FIDO2 or you don't have a FIDO2-capable
device, the other recommended method is [time-based one-time password (TOTP)](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/totp),
popularized by Google Authenticator. Nowadays, there are countless apps that can
generate TOTP, including [iOS/iPadOS' built-in authenticator](https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/07/use-ios-15-2fa-code-generator-plus-autofill-iphone/)
(I personally only recommend using it if you only use iOS/iPadOS and Safari on macOS),
[Authy](https://authy.com/) (a cross-platform synced authenticator), and
[Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447). I personally
use [Authenticator Pro](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.jmh.authenticatorpro)
(an [open-source](https://github.com/jamie-mh/AuthenticatorPro) authenticator for
Android) on my Android devices, and [OTP Auth](https://apps.apple.com/app/otp-auth/id659877384)
on my iOS devices. Most password managers offer to store TOTP keys in their vaults
for you, but that means that all your eggs are in one basket.

I try to avoid proprietary MFA solutions like Symantec VIP, which a lot of U.S.
financial institutions love[^5]. Instead, and only for those services, I use SMS
MFA. One big problem with SMS MFA is if you travel, you don't necessarily have access
to your texts. To prevent losing access to those services that use SMS, you could
use a service like [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) as the phone number
for MFA codes.

If you're curious about what MFA options a service offers, check out [2FA Directory](https://2fa.directory)[^7],
a directory of sites that support, and don't support, MFA. If a service is not there,
add it by following [our contribution guide](https://github.com/2factorauth/twofactorauth/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Reviewing Account Access

Have you ever been asked to sign in with Google, Twitter, Apple, Facebook, or some
other social platform? When you do that, those platforms share some data. For example,
with Google, it might be allowing an app to access your Google Drive to store configuration[^8].
Or with Twitter, an app may want the ability to view Tweets that you've posted and
accounts you follow. It's a good practice to periodically go through your platform's
security dashboards to review what apps have access to what. The table below contains
links to the dashboards of the most common platforms. If you don't recognize an
app or device linked to your account, remove it.

In addition to checking what apps are linked to your account, make sure to review
what devices are currently logged in to your account.

| Platform | App Access                                                                                                   | Logged-in Devices                                                                                  |

## Privacy Rights

If you're in the [European Economic Area](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area),
Canada, the U.S. states of California, Colorado, Utah, Virginia, or another area
that has [comprehensive data privacy legislation](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/magazine/beyond-gdpr-data-protection-around-world),
you have a few rights. EEA residents are protected by
[the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/subjects/rights-individual),
Canadian residents are protected by
[the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/),
California residents are covered by [the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)](https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/),
and so on, so forth. These regulations give individuals the right to know what personal
information an entity[^9] collects, the right to delete personal information collected,
the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, and the right to not
be discriminated against for exercising your rights.

A full list of rights can be found by clicking on the corresponding legislation
from the following non-exhaustive list of links: [GDPR (EEA)](https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/subjects/rights-individual),

[^8]: If an app is asking to access your entire Google Drive, check if it really needs that permission. For example, a game requesting that permission probably doesn't need that, and is using it for promotional or other purposes. Google offers developers a scoped permission that limits an app's access to a dedicated folder created just for them in your Google Drive. You might see this permission as "View and manage its own configuration in your Google Drive", or something similar.
[^9]: The definition of an entity depends on the legislation. For example, under the GDPR, entities refer to "a company or entity which processes personal data as part of the activities of one of its branches established in the EU, regardless of where the data is processed; or a company established outside the EU and is offering goods/services (paid or for free) or is monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the EU" (source: [Who does the data protection law apply to?](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/application-regulation/who-does-data-protection-law-apply)). For another example, under the PIPEDA, entities are defined as "private-sector organizations across Canada that collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of a commercial activity" (source: [PIPEDA in brief](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda_brief/)). For one last example, under the CCPA/CPRA, an entity is defined as a for-profit business that meets any of the following: have a gross annual revenue of over $25 million; buy, sell, or share the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents, households, or devices; or derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling California residentsâ€™ personal information (source: [Cal Civ. Code Â§ 1798.140(d)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1798.140.)).
