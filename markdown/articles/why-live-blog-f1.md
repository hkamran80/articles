My first exposure to Formula 1 was when I discovered the [Formula 1 Theme by Brian Tyler](https://open.spotify.com/track/5r7egnfTIQjaKSGREhIky9?si=2f7291ae08ee4e24),
shortly after the championship rebranded in 2017 after its purchase by Liberty Media. I looked into
Formula 1 a little but I was not interested in any sport other than football (soccer) at the time.
Then I watched David Letterman's interview with Lewis Hamilton on *My Next Guest Needs No Introduction*
and that led me to be a little interested sport, enough to know who some of the teams were and about
Lewis' records and championships. What really got me interested was watching *Drive to Survive* and
learning about all the technical and minute details in F1 that you do not see as a casual, infrequent
viewer.

I have been reading laws for fun for many years now. After binge-watching all six seasons of DTS
ahead of the 2024 season, I began reading the [sporting](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf)
and [technical regulations](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_technical_regulations_-_issue_8_-_2024-10-17.pdf).
After every race, I read through the infringement and decision documents and reports and looked at
the regulations to see why exactly penalties were issued. Side note: it is kind of annoying that the
FIA does not publish documents for red flags. You (or at least I) would think that the would necessitate
a document of some kind, but maybe it is because only the Technical Delegate and Stewards' documents
and reports are published and the Race Director is the one who calls for red flags?
