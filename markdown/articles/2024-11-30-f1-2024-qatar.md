  > any driver that exceeds the maximum time from the Second Safety Car Line to the First Safety Car
  > Line on ANY lap during and after the end of the sprint qualifying or qualifying session, including
  > in-laps and out-laps or during reconnaissance laps when the pit exit is opened for the sprint
  > and the race, may be deemed to be going unnecessarily slowly.

  That time was set in [Document 13 - Race Director's Notes - SC2 - SC1 Times](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Race%20Director%20Notes%20-%20SC2%20-%20SC1%20Times.pdf)

  (18:10 UTC, 10:10 PST).

  This is Tsunoda's second reprimand of the season. The Stewards noted that there was no evidence of
  unsafe or disorderly conduct, but a breach had occurred, so a Reprimand (Driving) was imposed.

## Qualifying

Qualifying is scheduled to begin at 21:00 AST (18:00 UTC, 10:00 PST) on Saturday, November 30.

### Session 1

- Kevin Magnussen (#20) had his 1:23.505 lap deleted for track limits at turn 1.
- Franco Colapinto (#43) had his 1:23.535 lap deleted for track limits at turn 6.
- Alex Albon (#23) had his 1:22.873 lap deleted for track limits at turn 6.
- Lance Stroll (#18) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 2.
- Kevin Magnussen (#20) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 4.
- Lando Norris (#4) had his 1:21.437 lap deleted for track limits at turn 6.
- Fernando Alonso (#14) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 10.

Alex Albon (#23), Liam Lawson (#30), Nico Hulkenberg (#27), Franco Colapinto (#43), Esteban Ocon
(#31) were eliminated in Q1.

The top three drivers were George Russell (#63) with a 1:21.241, followed by Charles Leclerc (#16)
with a 0.037 second gap (1:21.278), and Carlos Sainz (#55) with a 0.206 second gap (1:21.447).

### Session 2

- Sergio Perez (#11) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 4.

- Fernando Alonso (#14) had his lap deleted for track limits at turn 10.

- Carlos Sainz (#55) was fined €5,000 for a unsafe release from the garage into the pit lane and the
  path of Lewis Hamilton (#44).

  **Explanation:** [Article 34.14(a)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=42)
  says that "Cars must not be released from a garage or pit stop position in way that could endanger
  pit lane personnel or another driver". Sainz's release, seen in
  [this photo from the F1 Twitter account](https://twitter.com/F1/status/1862929472691015757),
  was deemed unsafe after the Stewards heard from Sainz, Hamilton, team representatives, and watched
  multiple videos. Sainz's number 1 mechanic signalled for him to be released before Sainz was ready,
  resulting in a small delay which caused Hamilton to take evasive action when he was released.

  **Documents:** [Document 40 - Summons - Car 55 - Alleged unsafe release](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Summons%20-%20Car%2055%20-%20Alleged%20unsafe%20release.pdf),

Pierre Gasly (#10), Zhou Guanyu (#24), Valtteri Bottas (#77), Yuki Tsunoda (#20), and Lance Stroll
(#18) were eliminated from Q2.

The top three drivers were Max Verstappen (#1) with a 1:20.687, followed by Lando Norris (#4) with
a 0.296 second gap (1:20.983), and Charles Leclerc with a 0.313 second gap (1:21.000).

### Session 3

- Fernando Alonso (#14) had his 1:21.320 lap deleted for track limits at turn 10.

- Max Verstappen (#1) received a one grid place penalty and a single penalty point for driving
  unnecessarily slowly on a cool down lap, getting in the way of George Russell (#63).

  **Explanation:** [Article 33.4](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2055%20-%20Alleged%20unsafe%20release.pdf#page=40)
  says that no car may be driven "unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be
  deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person" at any time. Russell said that
  "if a car was going slow in a high speed corner, it should not be on the racing line." Verstappen
  did not comply with the Race Director's Event Notes by driving unnecessarily slowly, but the penalty
  was less than the usual three grid place penalty because neither Verstappen nor Russell
  were on push laps at the time of the incident.

  This penalty point is his sixth in the twelve-month period.

  which reads in part:
  > Any work not listed in Article 40.2 may only be undertaken with the approval of the Technical
  > Delegate following a written request from the Competitor concerned. It must be clear that any
  > replacement part a Competitor wishes to fit is the same in design and similar in mass, inertia
  > and function to the original. Any parts which are removed shall be retained by the FIA.

- Oscar Piastri (#81) has been summoned to the Stewards for an "Incident in Pit Entry ... during
  reconnaissance laps."

  **Documents:** [Document 59 - Summons - Car 81 - Pit lane incident (reconnaissance laps)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Summons%20-%20Car%2081%20-%20Pit%20lane%20incident%20(reconnaissance%20laps).pdf)

- Lance Stroll (#18) was given a ten-second penalty and two penalty points for causing a collision
  with Franco Colapinto (#23).

  **Explanation:** [I.S.C. Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2(d)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/4_-_appendix_l_2024_publie_le_17_october_2024.pdf#page=57)
  says that "causing a collision ... will be reported to the Stewards and may entail the imposition
  of penalties up to and including the disqualification of any driver concerned." Stroll took his
  car into Colapinto's in turn four on lap one. The stewards declined to grant the usual tolerance
  for lap one incidents because this was not due to crowding.

  **Documents:** [Document 57 - Infringement - Car 18 - Causing a Collision](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2018%20-%20Causing%20a%20Collision.pdf)

- Franco Colapinto was forced to retire from the race because of Stroll crashing into him on lap one.

- Esteban Ocon (#31) was forced to retire from the race because of a collision with Nico Hulkenberg
  (#27) on lap one. No penalty was given to Hulkenberg as it was deemed a racing incident and "no
  further investigation".

- The Safety Car was deployed at the end of lap one and returned to the pits at the end of lap four.

- Liam Lawson (#30) was given a ten-second penalty and two penalty points for causing a collision
  with Valtteri Bottas (#77).

  **Explanation:** [I.S.C. Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2(d)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/4_-_appendix_l_2024_publie_le_17_october_2024.pdf#page=57)
  says that "causing a collision ... will be reported to the Stewards and may entail the imposition
  of penalties up to and including the disqualification of any driver concerned." Lawson understeered
  into Bottas on turn one on lap five.

  **Documents:** [Document 58 - Infringement - Car 30 - Causing a Collision](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2030%20-%20Causing%20a%20Collision.pdf)

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) was given a five-second penalty for a false start.

  From the F1 live blog:
  > It looks like Hamilton reacted before the start, stopped and then went when the lights went out
  > - which is why his start was so poor, and how he dropped three positions..

  When he learned he was under investigation, this [radio message was sent](https://livetiming.formula1.com/static/2024/2024-12-01_Qatar_Grand_Prix/2024-12-01_Race/TeamRadio/LEWHAM01_44_20241201_191115.mp3).
  > Hamilton: Sorry about that, guys.
  > Bono (race engineer): Eh, no problem, Lewis. Uh, yeah, made a decent recovery.
  > Hamilton: Yeah, lost so much ground on the start.

  **Explanation:** [Article 48.1(a)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=58)
  says that drivers cannot "move after the four (4) second light is illuminated and before the start
  signal is given by extinguishing all red lights". Hamilton having jumped the start and immediately
  stopping, violated this rule.

  **Documents:** [Document 63 - Infringement - Car 44 - False Start](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2044%20-%20False%20Start.pdf)

- Lance Stroll (#18) retired from the race after serving his penalty.

- George Russell (#63) has a very slow stop: 7.0 seconds.

- Alex Albon (#23)'s wing mirror flew off on the pit straight into the middle of the track. Yellow
  and double yellow flags are being waved.

- Valtteri Bottas (#77) ran over the mirror, spreading debris across the track.

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) and Carlos Sainz (#55) both received punctures to their front left tyres.

- The Safety Car has been deployed, four laps later than it should have been. It will drive through
  the pit lane.

- Lando Norris (#4) alleged that Lewis Hamilton (#44) brake tested him. It looked more like Hamilton
  realized he was speeding and braked to slow down right before the pit lane limiter line.

- After pitting under the Safety Car for the second time (medium -> hard, hard -> medium), Fernando
  Alonso (#14) was released alongside Kevin Magnussen (#20). Alonso overtook Magnussen at the end of
  the pit lane.

- Sergio Perez (#11) has lost drive and parked the car on lap 40 as the Safety Car returns to the
  pit lane.

- Nico Hulkenberg (#27) spun and beached his car in the gravel in turn ten.

- The Safety Car has been redeployed and comes back into the pits two laps later. The lights on the
  car did not turn off before racing was underway because it was already in the pit lane.

- Lando Norris (#4) has been given a ten-second stop-and-go penalty and three penalty points for
  failing to slow under yellow flags (sector one, pit straight) on lap 32. This incident was reported
  by Max Verstappen (#1).

  **Explanation:** [I.S.C. Appendix H, Article 2.5.5(b)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/appendix_h_2024_published_30.10.2024.pdf#page=18)
  says that double-waved yellow flags require drivers to "reduce your speed significantly, do not
  overtake, and be prepared to change direction or stop. There is a hazard wholly or partly blocking
  the track and/or marshals working on or beside the track."
  [Document 3 - Race Director's Event Notes](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Race%20Director's%20Event%20Notes%20.pdf#page=2)
  also requires drivers to comply with the single- and double-waved yellow flags throughout all
  sessions.

  These are Norris' only penalty points in the twelve-month period.

  **Documents:** [Document 64 - Infringement - Car 4 - Failing to slow under double waved yellow flags](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%204%20-%20Failing%20to%20slow%20under%20double%20waved%20yellow%20flags.pdf)

- Lewis Hamilton (#44) was given a drivethrough penalty for speeding in the pit lane (see incident
  with Norris). As he comes through the pit lane, he asks to retire the car and is denied by his team.
  After the drivethrough, he asks to come through and turn off the car, but the team convinces him
  not to.

- Alex Albon (#23) was given a ten-second penalty and two penalty points for forcing Kevin Magnussen
  (#20) off the track.

  **Explanation:** [I.S.C. Appendix L, Chapter IV, Article 2(d)](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/4_-_appendix_l_2024_publie_le_17_october_2024.pdf#page=57)
  says that "causing a collision ... will be reported to the Stewards and may entail the imposition
  of penalties up to and including the disqualification of any driver concerned." Albon oversteered
  in turn one at the apex, corrected it, but collided with Magnussen, forcing him off the track.

  These are Albon's only penalty points in the twelve-month period.

  **Documents:** [Document 62 - Infringement - Car 23 - Causing a collision](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/decision-document/2024%20Qatar%20Grand%20Prix%20-%20Infringement%20-%20Car%2023%20-%20Causing%20a%20collision.pdf)

- George Russell (#63) has been given a five-second penalty for falling more than ten car lengths
  behind under the Safety Car.

  **Explanation:** [Article 55.7](https://www.fia.com/sites/default/files/fia_2024_formula_1_sporting_regulations_-_issue_7_-_2024-07-31.pdf#page=62)
  mandates that all cars "reduce speed and form up in line behind the safety car no more than ten
  car lengths apart". Russell failed to abide by this during the third Safety Car.
