# Articles

This is the home of all my articles and notes. Any updates to this repository automatically
update my [website](https://hkamran.com) through the [workflow](.github/workflows/revalidate.yml).

## Structure

The [contents file](markdown/contents.json) is where all metadata about the articles
and notes are stored, including title, subtitle, description, publish date, and more.

All articles and notes are in the `markdown` folder. The `html` folder is there only
for historical purposes.
