The Interborough Express (IBX), a new project to directly connect Brooklyn and Queens for the first time, is in development with plans to bring the first modern light rail to NYC.
Currently to travel between the two boroughs, you have to take the subway through Manhattan.

> Manhattan is a lovely place, but why did people envision a world where you had to go there first to be able to come out to another borough?

The project was originally proposed in 1996 as the Triboro Express in the Regional Plan Association's [Third Regional Plan](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/rpa-org/pdfs/RPA-Plan3-A-Region-at-Risk-S150OPT.pdf#page=192) that would connect Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx.
As part of the [Fourth Regional Plan (November 2017)](https://rpa.org/work/reports/the-fourth-regional-plan#fourth-plan-recommendations:~:text=The%20Fourth%20Plan%20advocated%20for%20the%20creation%20of%20a%20rail%20line), the RPA proposed the rail line again [with funding from congestion pricing](http://fourthplan.org/action/tolling).
Since New York governor Kathy Hochul took office in 2021, she has "become a [champion of the IBX](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-12-11/nyc-s-interborough-express-is-on-track-to-transform-brooklyn-and-queens), making it a [high priority at the state-run MTA](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-plans-move-forward-major-new-expansion-transit-service-brooklyn-and)".

## Modes

In October, the MTA released the [Draft Scoping Document](https://www.mta.info/document/187036), which, among other items, discusses the transit modes.
They considered six modes: commuter rail, diesel multiple unit, subway (heavy rail), automated guideway, light rail, and bus rapid transit.
A total of 12 alternatives were considered, but the general consensus seems to be [light rail](https://www.mta.info/document/187036#page=13) given that it "offered the most benefits of all mode options" and represents a "cost-effective and constructible project mode" that could be "procured 'off the shelf' with minimal customization from a relatively large vendor pool".
For comparison, the [NYC subway cars ("rolling stock")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway_rolling_stock) (and most subway cars) are currently custom-built by Alstom and Kawasaki.
